      <h2>Growing the Bird of Paradise</h2>
      Give bird of paradise a spot in full sun for best growth and most flowers. The exception to that is in the hottest regions, where partial shade protects plants from strong sun and heat.
      Plants in full sun tend to be shorter with smaller flowers, while part-shade plants grow taller with larger flowers.
      Fertile, rich soils with good drainage produce best growth and flowering. Add compost or other organic matter to soil prior to planting.
      Avoid planting in a spot with poor drainage. Plants tend to fan out as they grow, and more flowers form along the outside edges of the plant clump.
      Space plants 4' to 6' apart to allow for ample spread and flowering. If planting near a walk or driveway, position the plant 4' to 5' away.

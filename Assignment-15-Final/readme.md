1. I learned that Github is great for seeing past versions.  The desktop version makes it great to upload and update elements.
2. I learned more about how to set up a website and what things need to be added to add different fonts.  The other new thing was labeling sites in the header and making sites compatible for mobile
3. I didn't really have any challenges I think my biggest problem was not having a PDF to reference.  I had to keep pulling up the Moodle.

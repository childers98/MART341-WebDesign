1. A system font is installed on your device and aren't necessarily available on the web because they are not set up for it.  Web fonts are custom fonts from a server and don't have to be on the user's device.  They are made specifically for the web but don't always work.  Web-safe fonts are dependable because they are used on both the windows and mac operating systems.

2. Having a fallback font or stack is important because not all operating systems share the same font types.  Having the fallback fonts allows the operating systems to pick which font you would rather have and also still display your text.

3. The most challenging part this week was adding the fonts.  I just followed along with the videos, I think the one I did was definitely the easiest. I also had a little challenge with messing with new elements but they seem to have worked out.

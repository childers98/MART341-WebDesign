    <h2>The Shivers Between Us</h2>
  </div> 

  <div class="one">
    <p>This was new.  Chase hadn’t seen her laugh with anybody else like that.  He gave them small glances over his shoulder as he pulled his things from his locker.  Through the crowds of people he watched as Autumn’s face lit up.
    She looked at Chase once, smiled, and returned to talking to the new guy.
    Was that meant for him or me?
    Him, he decided.  It was meant for him not me.
    Chase didn’t mean anything to her anymore.  Someone else made her happier than he ever could.  She would always mean the world to him.  Even if he was nothing but a passing storm.
    A breeze chilled him.
    Winter was coming.
    A nagging question still blew around in Chase’s head; could he be happy without Autumn?
    It was hard to forget someone that you had imagined spending forever with.
    Passing her in the hallway everyday was torture.  Everyday she stopped with him at his locker.  From across the hallway Chase would watch them.  The new guy was everything he would never be.
    Autumn was all he had ever known.  He wasn’t prepared for the cold.
    He missed her.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="two">
    Even though she was never his.
    Autumn knew though.  She knew that deep down she had always been Chase’s.  Autumn couldn’t get him off her mind.  She found herself smiling just at the thought of him.
    Chase had become a piece of her.  She wanted him.  All of him.
    Autumn and the new guy had become fast friends and she could tell he liked her.  She just didn’t feel the same.  He was all that she could’ve ever hoped for in someone, but there was still something inside her that wouldn’t let her take that final step.  She told herself she could move on, that she could be happy without Chase, but Autumn found her thoughts constantly wandering to him.  Wondering if he ever felt the same way that she did.  This feeling that she had was killing her.
    Autumn convinced herself that she was fine without him.  Although all she could draw was him.  She was forbidden to draw anything else.
    Chase on the other hand found himself writing about her.  He was cursed.  Doomed to forever tell their tale.
    Autumn could’ve read all of those pieces and still never have known that they were about her.
    Autumn was ripping Chase apart, and Chase was destroying Autumn.
    They needed each other, but the universe was driving a wedge in between them.  They knew that soon enough they would just be painful memories to each other.  Something that could’ve been.
    And, just like that, Autumn vanished and only winter was left. <br />

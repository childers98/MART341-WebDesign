1. I've typically come across subscription(newsletter) forms, account creation forms, order forms, and contact forms.  Most of these forms serve to gather some sort of information so that an interaction can happen between the user and the company.

2. An example of text input is password input.  This input hides the characters that are being typed into the field.  
A checkbox selection is another great input element.  This allows the user to select multiple or one type of answer depending on what is used.
Button input is something that allows you to submit things one example of this is the image button which allows a picture to represent the submit button.

3. This week I just went through the course website and the homework at the same time.  I looked at one step and worked through the site until I found what I needed to complete that part of the homework.  Then for other aspects I looked around online for more examples (like the color names for different options in my table).

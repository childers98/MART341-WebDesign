1. The world wide web is the pages you see while online with a device whereas the internet is all of the connected  devices.
2. The internet works by connecting many devices from around the world through networking.  Each of these networks then can connect to each other creating a larger connected system of devices that can share packets of information between them all.
3. A directory is the main area where files are stored.  Subdirectories can be added to the main one to create more organization between files. It is basically like using a filing cabinet (or other organizational system) but through electronic means.
4. VCS benefits the user by keeping track of changes so that the user can see if the change negatively or positively impacted the work.  Many people may also work on the file at any time and it helps store all the different versions.  For me this would be great to see and not progress or when some point in my code has failed.  Not to mention it would allow others to make changes.
6. My favorite kind of art is probably painting.

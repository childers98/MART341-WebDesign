1. The universal selector will change everything within the document.  The element selector only changes the defined elements of the same type.  The class selector changes all of the divs with the class. ID selectors pick out individual ids of the elements.

You might chose universal to change the entire document.  Element to make certain elements all look the same.  You may want to make everything with a certain class look the same but not all of the elements to create sections.  With IDs you might just want to change one little thing about a document and effect nothing else.

2. I chose to work with a secondary color palette because I feel like I hardly ever see them used and I like the colors.  I was also feeling like I was doing a lot of monochromatic stuff recently. Which is why I made the change to something more complex and harder to do.

3. The only challenge that I had this week was deciding how exactly I was going to get my colors to fit together properly.  I think it turned out alright though.

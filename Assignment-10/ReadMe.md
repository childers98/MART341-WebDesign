1. The universal selector will change everything within the document.  The element selector only changes the defined elements of the same type.  The class selector changes all of the divs with the class. ID selectors pick out individual ids of the elements.

You might chose universal to change the entire document.  Element to make certain elements all look the same.  You may want to make everything with a certain class look the same but not all of the elements to create sections.  With IDs you might just want to change one little thing about a document and effect nothing else.

2. I chose to work with a 90s themed palette since that's when these hairstyles started coming into the mainstream.  Dull but bright looking colors.

3. The only challenge that I had this week was deciding how exactly I was going to get my colors to fit together properly.  I think it turned out alright though.

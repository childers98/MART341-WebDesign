    <h2>Hair Types</h2>
    <div id="hair-structure" class="intro-text">
      <p>When we talk about hair structure, we’re referring specifically to the thickness of the strands, which can affect how well your hair will hold styles and react with certain products. Generally, your hair can fall into three categories: fine, medium, and coarse (or thick).</p>

    <div id="curl-types" class="end-text">
      <p>Your hair type is primarily based on your hair’s curl pattern. The amount of curl in your hair is determined by your hair follicle. The shape of your follicle determines whether your hair is straight, wavy, curly, or coily.
        The more oval or asymmetrical your follicle is, the curlier your hair will be.
        Your hair type is determined by genetics.
        You can alter your curl pattern with heat or chemicals, and your curl pattern can changed somewhat by hormones or medications you’re taking, but your basic curl pattern is in your DNA.
        Every time your hair goes through its growth cycle, those genetic characteristics are reasserted.
        What types of hair are there?
        Andre Walker, known for decades as Oprah Winfrey’s stylist, is credited with devising a system that classifies hair according to one of four curl patterns:
          <ul>
            <li>Type 1 - Straight hair</li>
            <li>Type 2 - Wavy hair</li>
            <li>Type 3	- Curly hair</li>
            <li>Type 4	- Coily hair</li>
          </ul>

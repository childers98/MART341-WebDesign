      <p> Hair-braiding styles were used to help differentiate tribes, locations, and also possibly a symbol of wealth and power due to the amount of effort that went into styling braids. Box braids were not given a specific name until the 1990s when popularized by R&B musician Janet Jackson, but have been used for years. Becoming popular again in the 1990s up until the present day.
        There have been several other types of braids known for their protective nature including:
          <ul>
            <li>Twist Outs</li>
            <li>Bantu Knots</li>
            <li>Weaves</li>
            <li>Cornrows</li>
          </ul>

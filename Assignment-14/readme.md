1. I choose bootstrap(maybe should have tried a different one)
2. I used the CDN just because linking the local file to all of the different pages that I have might've gotten a little bit complicated.
3. HTML5 allows for more advanced aspects to be used by more people.  It could also possibly make the web more secure, efficient, and adaptable.
4. My biggest challenge was probably trying to get the script to work. I ended up working on it with a friend and we were both over complicating it.

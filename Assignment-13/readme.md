1. My imaginary client for this week was myself.  I needed a site that was simple and that could display the types of content that I needed, which is mostly art related things.

2. It is important to consider a mobile first design because more and more users are turning to accessing the internet from their smartphone rather than computer.

3. My main challenge that I had this week was keeping all of my tags straight it created a problem for me in my dropdown menu as I sorted out which was which.  The only other thing was making sure that I completely all of the numbers on the homework assignment list (which I am pretty confident that I did all of them).
